**How do you implement the tasks in the checklist? Explain in a step-by-step manner (not just copy-paste from the tutorial).**
1. Create a new django project.
    - First, I created a new directory named “assignment2_pbp” on my computer files.
    - Then, I opened the terminal and navigated to the “assignment2_pbp” directory.
    - Inside that directory, I created a virtual environment by running “python -m venv env” and activated it by running “source env/bin/activate”. When the virtual environment is already started, the terminal will display “(env)”. 
    - I made a “requirements.txt” file in the directory and used “pip install -r requirements.txt”to install the necessary dependencies. 
    - Following that, I created a django project named “assignment2_pbp” by running “django-admin startproject assignment2_pbp .”. 
    - I opened the directory on my vscode, opened the “settings.py” file, and changed the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable to “ALLOWED HOSTS = [“*”]”. 
    - To make sure the “manage.py” file is activated, I ran “.manage.py runserver” and then browsed https://localhost:8000 to see if my Django application had already been successfully constructed. After that, I made a new public GitHub repository named “assignment2-pbp” and added, committed, and pushed my “assignment2_pbp” directory to it. 
    - In my directory, I created a “.gitignore” file. Then, I added, committed, and pushed my “.gitignore” file.

2. Create an app with the name “main” on that project.
    - I ran “python manage.py startapp main” to create a new application.
    - Then, I opened the “settings.py” file in my directory and added “main” to the list of existing applications.
    
3. Create a URL routing configuration to access the “main” app.
    - I added this following code in my “urls.py” inside my “assignment2_pbp” directory
    ```
    from django.urls import path, include
    from main.views import show_main
    
    app_name = 'main'
    
    urlpatterns = [
        path('', show_main, name='show_main'),
        path('main/', include('main.urls')),
    ]
    ```

4. Create a model on the “main” app.
    - On the “models.py” inside the “main” app, I added this following code:
```
from django.db import models
class Product(models.Model):
name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
amount = models.IntegerField()
description = models.TextField()
```

5. Create a function in “views.py” that returns an HTML template.
    - I added this following code into the “views.py” file:
```
from django.shortcuts import render
def show_main(request):
context = {
'name': 'Raisa Fadilla',
'class': 'PBP KI'
}
return render(request, 'main.html', context)
```

Then, I changed the “main.html” code into this:
```
<h1>Product List Page</h1>
<h5>Name:</h5>
<p>{{ name }}</p>
<h5>Class:</h5>
<p>{{ class }}</p>
```

6. Create a routing in ”urls.py” to map the function in “views.py”.
    - I added this following code in "urls.py" inside the "main" app:
```
from django.urls import path
from main.views import show_main

app_name = 'main'
urlpatterns = [
    path('', show_main, name='show_main'),
    ]
```

7. Deploy the app to Adaptable so it can be accessed through the internet.
    - I opened adaptable.io and signed in by using my GitHub account.
    - I clicked "New App" and choosed "Connect an Existing Repository"
    - Then, I choosed "assignment2_pbp" repository for the application to be deployed and selected "master" branch to use as the deployment branch.
    - Following that, I choosed "Python App Template" as the deployment template and "PostgreSQL as the database type to be used.
    - I changed the pyton version to 3.10 and typed "python manage.py migrate && gunicorn assignment2_pbp.wsgi" for the start command.
    - To start the process of deploying the application,  I selected "Deploy App" and then checked the "HTTP Listener on PORT option".
   
9. Create a README.md that contains a URL to access your deployed app and answers to the questions
    - I created the README.md and answered all the questions in this GitHub Repository.


**Create a diagram explaining the flow of client requests to a Django web app and its response. Also in the diagram, explain the connections between urls.py, views.py, models.py, and the HTML file(s).**

**What is the purpose of a virtual environment? Can we create a Django web app without a virtual environment?**
A virtual environment isolates and manages project-specific dependencies. It is possible to create a Django web app without a virtual environment, however it is not recommended because it may generate dependency problems.

**What is MVC, MVT, and MVVM? Explain the differences between the three.**
1. MVC
   - Model: stores the application data and responsible, responsible for handling the real-world business rules, and communication with the database and network layers.
   - View: user interface layer that holds components that are visible on the screen.
   - Controller: updates the application's state by accepting user input, processing it, and communicating with the Model and View.
   
3. MVT
   - Model: stores the application data and responsible, responsible for handling the real-world business rules, and communication with the database and network layers.
   - View: user interface layer that holds components that are visible on the screen.
   - Template: manages the state of the View and takes actions according to the user's input notification from the View
   
5. MVVM
   - Model: stores the application data and responsible, responsible for handling the real-world business rules, and communication with the database and network layers.
   - View: user interface layer that holds components that are visible on the screen.
   - ViewModel: exposes the essential data streams to the View, acting as a bridge between the Model and the View.
